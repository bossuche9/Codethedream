# How to set up

This was developed in a linux environment

You will have to pull this into a folder/ Download Code as a zip(green code button with a drop down arrow).

I will advise using github codespaces(highly recommended for easy set up)/V.S Code/ a linux terminal .

This app devDependencies":
    vite: 6.0.11
    
if you do not have a linus(wsl)/ bash installed, go to git-scm.com/downnloads. Downloads for your OS(mostly likely 64 bit).

Open the file ending with bit.exe, downlaod and install.

There will be different customisation for git while installing, or main objective is to use it as a terminal to run our code

after pulling/ downloading/ using git hub codespace.
In the terminal
cd into where you pulled/ downloaded the folder. then
 enter `cd Codethedream-main`
 then `cd Codethedream-project`
 run `npm install` in the terminal , to get all dependencies listed in package.json.

Hopefully, you should see something like,but not exactly :
added 11 packages, and audited 12 packages in 856ms

3 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details.

  Now run `npm run dev`

  and click on the  Local: htttps:{link} in the terminal.

  There is a search bar that can be used to find images of the dog on the first page and a dog details page showing the details of the dog like weight and LifeSpan.
